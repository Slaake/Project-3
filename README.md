# Corner Grocer Project

## Scenario

You are doing a fantastic job at Chada Tech in your new role as a junior developer, and you exceeded expectations in your last assignment for Airgead Banking. Since your team is impressed with your work, they have given you another, more complex assignment. Your task is to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which should incorporate all of their requested functionality.

The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.

## Directions

This project was created to help a ficticious compnay with thier inventory system. In this project, I used OOP concepts to build out methods and a simple UI to help the company look up infomration. I found that this project helped me to gain more pratice and understanding of OOP and other options in which it can be used for. 

Downloading the files and .TXT file with the inventory to parse will output to the console with different options of search for an item, see all item in either a number or historgram or quit the program.
