# Corner Grocer Project

## Summary
This project was created to solve for an issue that the Company Chanda Tech had for one of their clients. This project used object orientated programming to help develop a solution for managing inventory created by a text file. The program will allow for searching for products, displaying a count of sold products and displaying a histogram. 

## What did you do particularly well?
I believe I organized the code well in the different files, provided good inline comments and allowed for easy extensions to the functionality of the program. While I have had experience working with object orientated programming before, this project helped to reinforce how I can build out future programs using object orientated principals.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would like to be able to allow for inputting new text files via the console so that the user would not need to hard code or rely on specific naming of the text files for the program to work. Additionally, I would like to be able to add a method for updating the inventory provided in the text file in case of human errors when collecting inventory numbers. These improvements would help to provide more features that Corner Grocer could use to make their job more efficient. 

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found adding the feature of normalization to item searching in option 1 to be the most difficult. Languages like Python make this kind of enhancement easier to implement but with C++ this took longer to research, test and complete. I was able to use Cplusplus.com and Stack Overflow to help work out how to add this to the program.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
While object orientated programing was introduced in a prior class, the work in this project help to reinforce that knowledge and understanding. I struggled to find out how object orientated would be better than functional programming but after this project, I now have a far clearer understanding on how and when to use object orientated programming. 

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By creating this program using object orientated principals, new methods can be added to the main class of CorcerGrocer which can extended the functionality of the program and have it adaptable to new features. To keep it maintainable, each of the methods have inline comments as well as clearly named variables for their function that they are responsible for to keep the program readable. I aimed to keep all best practices and object orientated concepts top of mind when developing this program.

### Scenario

You are doing a fantastic job at Chada Tech in your new role as a junior developer, and you exceeded expectations in your last assignment for Airgead Banking. Since your team is impressed with your work, they have given you another, more complex assignment. Your task is to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which should incorporate all of their requested functionality.

The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.

### Directions

This project was created to help a ficticious compnay with thier inventory system. In this project, I used OOP concepts to build out methods and a simple UI to help the company look up infomration. I found that this project helped me to gain more pratice and understanding of OOP and other options in which it can be used for. 

Downloading the files and .TXT file with the inventory to parse will output to the console with different options of search for an item, see all item in either a number or historgram or quit the program.
